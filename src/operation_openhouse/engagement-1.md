**-- BRIEFING DETAILS --**
__Operation Name__: Openhouse

__Situation:__ The Death of Ben has caused an imbalance between the three factions of the island. Ben was meant to hold back the full might of Bosnian forces in order to balance the scales for Lika Xhevet. Now that he is gone, the Bosnians have gathered enough support to launch an aerial assault upon the Serbian occupied territories. Word of mouth reached the Croatians who are launching a ground assault at the same time. The territory is turning into a war zone, putting our contracter Xhevet in mortal danger. Without him, there is no Openhouse and their is no compensation.

__Mission:__ Rescue Lika Xhevet from the war zone and bring him to MOB Mermaid for security

__Execution:__
