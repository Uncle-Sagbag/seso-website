# About S.E.S.O.

## SESO or S.E.S.O.?
Often seen in SESO documents such as this website is the spelling of the name as `SESO` or `S.E.S.O.` Both are valid. `SESO` is an acronym so there should be periods between every letter to indicate the start of four words. However, acronyms can be written without periods as well. If one is conflicted on which term to use, use `S.E.S.O.` when you are writing a title and `SESO` when you are writing in the body.

In any case, avoid writing `S.E.S.O` without the period for the `O`. If there are periods for the acronym, every letter should be marked with a dot.
