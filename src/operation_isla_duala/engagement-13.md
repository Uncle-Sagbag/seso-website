__Operation Name:__ Califia Farms

__Situation:__ Ramon was able to get in touch with a political official who is willing to leak government information for us. He will act as our inside man during the Heist. However, to earn his information, we have to rob a wealthy general store and steal $3,000 US Dollars. It doesn't sound like much, however, combined with the high inflation and the low reliability of political officials, it will do more than enough.

__Execution:__
1. Acquire the UN truck
2. Move to the town of Simbala
3. Avoid and defend against enemy fire
4. Rob the General Store and find the box full of "bananas"
5. Safely bring the cargo back to Ramon's Plantation
