__Operation Name:__  **Water Nymph** 

__Situation:__ A UN-escorted **band of refugee boats** disappeared overnight in the Communist occupied waters in the North Eastern rivers. Another **UN escort** was sent to investigate the matter and never returned, radio silent S.E.S.O. have been hired to finally come in and find out what have been causing the disappearances.

__Mission:__ Investigate the crash site and find the refugees.

__Execution:__ You will enter the area **by helicopter**. The pilot must be selected among you and it better be your best pilot: **the helicopter acts as a mobile spawn point**, much better than the static spawn points that randomly appear.

You will need to make way towards the occupied waters during the night to avoid bringing attention to yourselves in the air. When observing the waters, be on the **lookout for any boat wrecks and craters**. When you do find it, **land on the area and investigate the ruins**. Hopefully, you could confirm to HQ what occurred at the crash site.

__Enemy Intelligence:__ The island has been steadily losing its inhabitants . This means there shall be **no civilians apart** from our refugees. The enemy **will not have any AA unless you fly too deep into the occupied island**. They could have **anti-personnel** and **anti-tank missiles**, which are best avoided by quick thinking. There will **not be any mines**. The enemy in the Bakoro Desert portion of the island (the Southern portion of the North Eastern island) are least supplied, thus, expect only **small arms, ground missile launchers, and motorized infantry**.

__Operation Result:__ **Mission Success**
