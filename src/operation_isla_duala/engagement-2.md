__Operation Name: White Tiger__

__Mission:__ Infiltrate and acquire enemy logistics

__Execution:__ An insertion team will be prepared at an FOB not too far from the enemy compound. The team will disguise themselves as civilians, bypass the enemy checkpoints, and rearm far enough away.

Then, you will see the radio tower. The radio tower MUST be destroyed FIRST. This is to insure that no reinforcements will come our way. Avoid patrols and plant an explosive next to the wall of the radio tower. It will be damaged and it will spark the first combat scenario.

When things get hot, infiltrate the building in the compound, find the military documents, and escape back to the FOB. If we succeed, we will get ice cream and hot dogs at the base!

__Operation Result:__ Successful
