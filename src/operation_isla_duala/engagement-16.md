__Operation Name:__ Rain Check

__Situation:__ In the previous operation, the Namaquan forces's rocket artillery were triangulated and spotted North of Ramon's Plantation. That was foolish on their part because we will be taking that rocket artillery for ourselves. Currently, the rocket artillery are in a convoy is enroute from the Swonto Piley Airport to Molatia International Airport. If we could catch the convoy before they get to the airport, we will have an easier time engaging them. In the event that the rocket artillery is destroyed or the convoy reaches the destination, we will have to engage the heavily fortified Molatia International Airport to acquire their rocket artillery. By acquiring this artillery, we could eliminate any threat of armor and artillery during our final Heist.

__Execution:__
1. Reach the convoy route
2. Engage the convoy
3. Hijack as many rocket artillery as possible
4. Stash the artillery in one of the buildings marked on the map
5. If the artillery is destroyed or reaches the Molatia airport, engage the airport and repeat 3 to 4
