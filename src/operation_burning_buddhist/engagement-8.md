__Brief Type:__ Information

__Operation Name__ Burning Buddhist

__Engagement Number__ 8th

__Situation:__ Phoum Srei Aphsok or PSA is made up of three objectives with equal importance. In order to properly secure any portion of the town, no part of PSA must be available as a landing area for the ARVN. FULRO does not have the man power to hold a stalemate in this town so swift conquest is essential. 

PSA is a major stream connected to the largest river, Tonle Teuktnaot, in PKL. All the PBRs the ARVN leave behind can be utilized for future engagements near the shore.

__Mission:__ Capture OBJ Aphsok Bridge then OBJ Prey then OBJ Hillbilly

__Execution:__
1. Scout OBJ Aphsok Bridge
2. Command Cai Team and Delta Squad to engage
3. Engage OBJ Aphsok Bridge.
4. Command Delta Squad to engage OBJ Prey
5. Engage OBJ Prey
6. Command Delta Squad to engage OBJ Hillbilly
7. Capture FOB Tractor in OBJ Hillbilly

__Intel:__

The ARVN are better outfitted with greater number of vehicles, supports, and statics. However, their weakness is their lack of mobility, a trait more popular with their US counterparts. The ideal tactic to defeat the ARVN is to avoid their front and flank from their sides.

The ARVN have been dormant within the town due to a lack of combat recently. As a result, all PBRs are unmanned and in constant repair. Use this to your advantage and keep an eye on any hostiles attempting to man the vehicles.

SESO will be assisted with the Cai Team, four of the greatest snipers in FULRO. In addition, Delta Squad returns to split the ARVN's attention. Neither will engage without an explicit command from a SESO RTO to FOB Liquor.

__Engagement Result:__ Success!

PSA is conquered! FULRO grows stronger on land and on sea!
