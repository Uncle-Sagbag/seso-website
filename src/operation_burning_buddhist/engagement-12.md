__Brief Type:__ Information

__Operation Name:__ Burning Buddhist

__Engagement Number:__ 12th

__Situation:__ War is nearly upon FULRO and Western forces. All intelligence points to a complete wipeout of General Thi's forces once a full-scale battle occurs. For the safety of our SESO operatives, this engagement shall be the last of our operation before operatives EVAC down South of the PKL river.

General Thi has been holding back his share of pay until this moment. He states his ally, General Kỳ, can supply the rest of the pay if he is rescued from MOB Tet.

SESO can take a pit stop on the way out of PKL to infiltrate MOB Tet. With Kỳ in our palms, he will have no choice but to fulfill General Thi's share.

__Missions:__

Rescue General Kỳ

EVAC from PKL

__Execution:__
1. Load up  on PBRs
2. Travel down the river to the Mangrove Pit
NOTE: Expect contacts located at markers named Hostiles
3. Infiltrate MOB Tet
4. Sweep the area for General Ky before reinforcements arrive.
5. Return to the PBRs
6. Travel to AO EVAC

__Intel:__

There is one day until the full battle occurs. This means most of PKL has mobilized. SESO will be safest under the cover of night, otherwise Western artillery and air force will be in full operation in the morning.

The river has been mobilized as well. Thankfully, PBRs will be safe from infantry hiding in rural areas due to their lack of visibility. However, all bases and urban areas, such as the ones marked as "Hostiles" have statics guarding the waters. In addition, a handful of US Rivermen patrol areas outside and inside the "Hostiles" markers.

MOB Tet is primarily an intelligence base. However, this does not mean they are shy of statics themselves. Infantry and light armor contacts are expected. What is more troubling is the fact that MOB Tet is dangerously close to other mobilized bases such as JB Lincoln and FOB Dang Nghi. These bases are expected to reinforce the MOB the moment they receive the word.

__Operation Result:__ **Success!**

General Ky has been rescued and SESO have EVAC from PKL
