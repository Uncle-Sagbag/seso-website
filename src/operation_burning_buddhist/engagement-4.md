__Operation Name:__ Burning Buddhist

__Engagement Number:__ 4th

__Situation:__ The liberation of key hamlets in the previous engagement has cleared the way for friendly forces to move in.  They have already spent several days moving and preparing themselves for the assault on Hill Two-Twenty. Recently, one of the US Tracked Patrols have gone radio silent when passing FOB Forty-Nine, an abandoned PAVN base that has been battered to oblivion. CIDG Scouts also report that Forty-Nine is active again. SESO will be joining CIDG Sierra Scouts to investigate the FOB.

__Mission:__ Retrieve all remains of the US Patrol in FOB Forty-Nine

__Execution:__
1. Reach Hamlet Go Xe
2. Traverse the jungle on the footpath
3. Group up with Sierra Scouts
4. Enter and sweep FOB Forty-Nine
5. Return all remains (equipment, dog tags, and vehicles) of the US Tracked Patrol to FOB Penh

__Intel:__

Enemy forces are unknown. Sierra Scouts do not report any contacts in Forty-Nine yet see lights and vehicles during the night.

The CIDG Sierra Scouts are on stand-by on the footpath yet refuse to move any further into FOB Forty-Nine. SESO will be regrouping with them in an effort to move in to Forty-Nine.

Kiwi Artillery is available during this engagement. Since the artillery has moved, the ranges of the artillery has changed. The area within the blue circle is the ideal range of the artillery. Any artillery salvo will be accurate and exactly on GRIDREF. The area between the red circle and the blue circle is the approximate range of artillery. Salvos here will be inaccurate from 20m to 100m of GRIDREF. SESO operatives are able to call in three salvos on any positions within the ideal or approximate ranges.

__Operation Result:__ Success!

Most of the equipment have been retrieved from the patrol! SESO will be receiving a vehicle upgrade as a result.
