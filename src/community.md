# S.E.S.O. Communities
S.E.S.O. would be nothing without its projects and groups, which are categorized as communities. Below is the list of all community links, organized by seniority.

## [[S.E.S.O.] Casual Milsim Discord](https://discord.gg/h7aWmRGJwB)
The featured SESO community is the casual milsim unit. SESO often plays operations in Arma 3. If you wish to join our operations and contact other members of the unit, please join the Discord.


## [[S.E.S.O.] American Civil War Discord](https://discord.gg/DrwZg8RvQS)
Created by [Dylanisaboxofrocks1017](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198347623092) is a game modification for Paradox Interactive's [Hearts of Iron 4](https://store.steampowered.com/app/394360/Hearts_of_Iron_IV/). This mod depicts a civil war between individual states in continental America. States are led by members of SESO who are caricatures of their real-life selves. These members engage in conflicts based off real events in an operative's history.
