__Operation Name:__ Bub√°k

__Situation:__ Since our loss at the battle for the General Spy at our previous operation, command felt the need to relocate us to a barebones camp in the middle of the forest. We've been stationed there for two days for recon and further instructions. Korolenko has also been neutered of much of his own individualism and has been assigned to be with the conscripts at all times. The latest task we have been assigned is to track down and neutralize a team of corrupt police officials in the forests of Suchy vrch (Soo-kee Vir-kh). These officials often make illegal weapons deals with Sudeten German Party members. So we have decided to track them down and find them at one of the three places. However, these three places are all allegedly haunted sites. Intelligence claims making deals in least popular places as these provide a shield for illegal operations. Korolenko will be leading the conscripts to the three sites and each will be sweeped one by one.
