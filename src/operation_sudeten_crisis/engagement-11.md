__Contract:__ Hamr

__Operation Name:__ Whacka-mole

__Date:__ October 8th, 1938

__Situation:__ Oberst Lorenz and his lackeys while mapping out and planning the Operation for us, noticed a passage that is slightly out of the way providing a entrance to point Hamr without being a head on assault. Although this side passage is not heavily fortified it is still entrenched along the way, requiring us to clear any and all defenders on that road.

__Mission:__ Clear all 7 Trenches.

__Execution:__
1. Approach the trenches through the Secret Entrance
2. Clear out Trenches 1 through 4
3. Clear out Trenches 5 through 6

__Resources:__ Below are the available resources that a faction could utilize during an operation. The resources are always connected to the amount of zones controlled by a faction in the #marenice-campaign-map. This does not mean that these resources WILL appear this operation, most of them won't unless stated otherwise. These are just meant to serve as a marker of each faction's current strength.

__Available German Resources:__ S.S., Kleiner Panzer 1 Batch A, Panzer 3 Batch B, Panzer 3 Batch D, SFK, 8 cm Mortar Mo. 34

__Available Czech Resources:__ HMG Mo. 37, Policemen, 3.7 KPUV Mo. 37, HMG Mo. 7, Assault

__Operation Result:__ Failure.

4 trenches out of 7 were swept until the loss of all SESO tickets. We will have to repeat the operation one more time.


__Operation Result:__ Success!

All 7 trenches have been cleared out. Oberst Lorenz is enroute to setting up an FOB in the area now.
