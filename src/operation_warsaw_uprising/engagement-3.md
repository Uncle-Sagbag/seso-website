__Warsaw Operations:__

Now after stealing both the medical supplies and a tank we hold the ability to strike many locations with a greater chance of success with this armor, but rumors have circulated that German armor is on the move within this area due to the spike in partisan activity, but until then we hold the ability to take advantage of our new edge. Either securing more weapons for ourselves or stiffening German airpower within the region, the choice is up to us.

__Option 1:__

Steal weapons from the Depot and Crashed C-17

__Desc:__

We have been tipped off from our Allied connections that one of their C-17 transports that had been on the way to supply Warsaw directly was downed from German air within the area, they have given us this information in hopes we secure it before the Germans are able to ship it and steal it to elsewhere.

Along with that we have selected the Arms Depot and Barracks as a target for this raid, using our tank to overwhelm the garrison and steal the fully stocked trucks and bring them back to base.

__Plan:__

As I have mentioned there is two parts to this option, stealing supply boxes from the C-17 and from the depot, we know there is a minimal but still present bit of mechanized Germans in the area of both of the options so it is advised to take things slow, but the quick way of explaining the plan for the depot and crash site is this,

For the C-17 crash we have a approximate area of where the crash and boxes may be, but firstly you are to find it eliminate any Germans that may prove to be a hinderance near there, then load the equipment into any trucks you may bring and ship it back to base.

For the depot, you are to eliminate the garrison, secure the trucks loaded with supplies and also return them all to base.

__Option 2:__

Eliminate German officers within the area.

__Desc:__

Sifting through German communications our Allied compatriots contacted us with information of a movement of two officers from the 2nd SS Panzer Division moving within the area away from the front and onwards towards Warsaw. We are to go to any of the listed areas we have been tipped off to their possible presence and then see to it that they are eliminated. 

__Plan:__

You men together in conjunction with our armor are to investigate and attempt to kill any of the listed German Officers we have been informed of, and due to a high noted presence of armor ever increasing with the Officers arrival we can not afford to split off and must work together, well at least that's up to you, to decide if you need to or not.

We have received communications from the Soviets for the first time, they have asked us for a meeting to discuss some things, rather vague, and up to the group weather or not we should trust them.
