## What we offer
### Casual MilSim Atmosphere

We focus on having fun first, being tactical second. Our settings are configured for maximum enjoyment with the the least drag.

### Easily Accessible

No experience, no test, no minimum age, no microphone needed, no single-clanning requirement. Just have Arma 3 and a desire for cooperation.

### Rankless structure

We do not hold any ranks in the unit, in-game or outside. Yet, we still hold a structure and use common-sense tactics as defined in our [Tactics Training manual](https://wiki.sesounit.org/tutorials_guides:tactics_training). Anyone is permitted to choose any role they wish, whether it be squad leader, sniper, pilot, etc. as long as most of the group agrees with the role selection.

### Infantry-focused Combat

Infantry is the backbone of the unit and every vehicle is meant to support it. Most common roles we offer are:
* Designated Marksman 
* Engineer
* Medic 
* Machinegunner
* Sniper
* Scout
* Squad Leader
* Team Leader
* Radio Operator
* UAV Operator

### S.E.S.O. Canon Operations

Operations set in the S.E.S.O. canon are part of a storyline that spans decades. This means our operations can be set in any time period and setting. We have operated during the invasion of Czechoslovakia (Sudeten Crisis, 1938), the Vietnam War (Operation Burning Buddhist, 1965), the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone (Operation Green Diamond, 1988), and the Donbass War (Operation Black Bear, 2014). We also operate in fictional settings that are inspired by historical events such as a Yugoslavian Wars set on Fapovo Islands (Operation Openhouse, 1992), and a Southern African civil war on Isla Duala (Isla Duala Civil War, 2000).

### 24/7 Scenarios Server

Our dedicated server machine runs community-made scenarios on rotation, always available to play any time. This is available for all Operators, whether they attend operations or not. The current scenarios we play are Antistasi (with RHS mods), Manhunt, and Dynamic Recon Ops. Feel free to suggest more workshop missions.

### Hosting Engagements

It is possible for any Operator to become an Operation/Engagement Host. Ask Operations Command to feature your custom-made missions to the unit. There is no test or experience necessary. With enough experience, one can also contribute to the S.E.S.O. storyline. See the [Operation Standard](https://wiki.sesounit.org/tutorials_guides:operation_standard) for more details.

### Active Lounge

Every night, we gather in voice channels to play games. We are welcome for anyone to join in our multiplayer game sessions, mod developments, or just to chat.
