__Note:__

After some confusion SESO had eventually apprehended then eliminated the target. This came with much approval by NATO, but as seems to be a pattern with this war, there is not much time for a break or celebration, with a series of fire fights opening up on the border, it appears more trouble is on the horizon.

__Mission:__

NATO has tasked us with setting up a hasty defence in the towns of 'Oberusel West' and 'Oberusel Ost' in front of the oncoming Russian counter-offensive , this is the main road junction between our FOB and the Russian forces, so retreat is not an option. Only information given is that forward positions and other entrenched positions to the north have been in constant engagement, so word is that they're coming our way, giving SESO little time to put forward a stiff defence.

__Plan:__
1. Travel to 'Oberusel West' and 'Oberusel Ost'.
2. Construct a defence between the two towns.
3. Fend off Russian forces until a ample amount of reinforcements can arrive to salvage the situation.
4. Conduct and undertake any further orders passed on.
5. RTB.

**-'Oberusel West' and 'Oberusel Ost'**

This town on the initial day of the invasion had experienced combat between Russian and NATO forces, so there is some remains of the battle. Including statics, wrecks, war torn buildings, etc. This should provide some assistance in amassing a defence.

__Enemy Elements:__

Mirroring our own past operation: 'Uppercut' , the Russians have amassed heavy mechanised, armored, and air forces. All in hopes of pushing us out of our foothold in this AO.
