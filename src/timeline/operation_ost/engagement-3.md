__Description:__ 

After the failure that was 'Uppercut' NATO has decided to take a breather. Their offensives have proved to not work against the resilient Russian forces, so their efforts are refocused on more pressing matters East. So a temporary stalemate is expected as both sides catch their breath. But while the main forces of both sides are doing this, we are to conduct further espionage, as well as recover an asset, Codename: "Perseus". We have been told this is to not let the Russians get to conformable on their perch, but their appear to be triple the amount of eyes lurking on the result of this mission than typically, so it would be wise to complete this successfully.

__Method:__

SESO will be following the scent of a asset hostage, Codename: "Perseus". A lightly armed convoy was ambushed to our North, the detail contained German KSK operatives and the asset. They have not reported back since last night. So while we still have the time... we need to get there and search for any pointers to where he may be, following any details which should lead us back to his location. From there you should find some major Russian installation, if you have the time, detonate and destroy any equipment caches or communications equipment, but prioritize extraction of the asset. Simple as that.

__Plan:__
1: Go to convoy last know position.
2: Investigate for any clues.
3: Track clues back to the asset and extract him.
4: (Optional:) If possible detonate any equipment and communications hardware.

__Intel:__

Our intel of the asset goes as follows: He should be a Caucasian male, wearing slacks and have a American accent. But as we are following the equivalent of a bread trail to the asset, we cannot anticipate any forces that you may run into. But keep last mission as a reminder to the possible forces you may encounter. So to avoid encountering such units again, it is suggested you keep a lower profile, but it is not mandatory, just suggested.
