__Operation Name:__ Angola

__Engagement Number:__ 8

__Situation:__ The newfound intel released by our informant has revealed the secret that the Mawt Nation has been hiding from us. Sergeants Kagn and Coti, occupiers of the neighboring town of Mawembela, are defecting to the Mawt side. This creates a conflict of interest as your goal is the neutralization of all Bantu officers. An explicit attack on the Mawties would create another front to the war. Rather, the officers will be neutralized during their meeting with the Mawties. Both sides will arrive to the meeting with vehicles. The Mawt vehicles will be rigged with explosions as to neutralize the officers in their blast. Fighting will erupt as both sides will believe the meeting was rigged by the enemy. This cannot be done explicitly so certain SESO operatives will dress as Mawties before entering Mawt territory. There are no uniforms available at base, but the nearby refugee camp contains Mawt prisoners who could be convinced to support our cause. The prisoners were captured from an attack on their patrol by the Tasmeran guerillas. They haved occupied the camp as their FOB against Kinsella for weeks. The Mawties have long since asked to attack the camp, but there has been no advantage for us until now.

In addition, a new base of operations will be necessary for future clandestine attacks on the Mawties. The refugee camp is large enough to house all of our equipment and allow us to recquisition vehicles from the AO. If the camp can be captured, operatives may store found equipment without donating it to the Mawt cause. Communications between our contratee and OPSCOM will continue on this camp.

1. Bring 3 explosive satchels

Enemy forces are the Bantus and the Tasmeran guerillas. Independent forces are the Mawties, who are not hostile to us but do not support this engagement.

Bantu forces are mostly infantry with motorized units. Bantus arm their vehicles and their rooftops with statics to better occupy objectives.

Tasmera, the South-Western region of Isla Duala, is home to the Tasmeran guerillas. They are known for their ambushes, whether by car or on foot. The desert expanse east of Kinsella is patrolled by their motorized squads while Tasmera proper hides the guerilla infantry. When they attack, they utilize whistles as a signals and to harm the enemy morale.

Hotel 1 will provide their helicopter for Bravo. Hotel 2 will provide the UAV operator with thermal vision over the battlefield. A technical armed with an M2 machine gun and a technical armed with an SPG launcher are available in the garage. They may be slingloaded with Hotel 1.
