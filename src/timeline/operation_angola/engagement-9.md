__Operation Name:__ Angola

__Engagement Number:__ 9

__Situation:__ The move to the new forward operating base located in the refugee camp, named FOB Haven, has been OPSCOM’s main objective lately. The final move, the transport of the arsenal, is reserved for the operatives as a form of celebration.

However, the new FOB is missing OPSCOM themselves. In fact, this briefing was written by an intern who has seen it all happen (P.S. please tell me if they’re are any speling mistakes, I want to gain experience). OPSCOM was ambushed in between the nearby airport and the FOB by Tasmera guerillas. The guerillas took OPSCOM as hostages along with the armed technicals. There is no intel beyond the initial point of contact. Please bring them back, I don’t think I can keep a payroll without them!

__Mission:__ Rescue OPSCOM from the Tasmera guerillas

__Execution:__
1. Sling load the arsenal at FOB Ramon
2. Deliver and drop off the arsenal at FOB Haven
3. Familiarize oneself with FOB Haven's facilities
4. Investigate the Point of Contact
5. Report findings to LDR for advice
6. Find the probable locations of OPSCOM
7. Rescue OPSCOM
8. RTB

Enemy forces are the Tasmeran guerillas.

Tasmera, the South-Western region of Isla Duala, is home to the Tasmeran guerillas. They are known for their ambushes, whether by car or on foot. The desert expanse east of Kinsella is patrolled by their motorized squads while Tasmera proper hides the guerilla infantry. When they attack, they utilize bells as signals and to harm the enemy morale.

Hotel 1 will provide their helicopter for Bravo. Hotel 2 will provide the UAV operator with thermal vision over the AO. Technicals will not be available as they were captured by the guerillas.
