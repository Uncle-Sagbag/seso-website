__Operation Name:__ Angola

__Engagement Number:__ 5

__Situation:__ The island of Hazena has sustained combat for several days since Kalunga’s invasion. Late KINWAR’s mechanized forces defeated the pirates. Our local contacts have gone radio silent since the previous engagement. There is no direct route to the island as the infrastructure is destroyed, including the bridge. All that is left are smoke and ruin.

The 91st, 92nd, and 94th Kinsella Mechanized Platoons are on standby for orders from KINWAR, aloof to its disappearance. SESO will take advantage of this by neutralizing their officers at the first break of light. The platoons have been severely weakened by the pirates. Their wounded are vulnerable and their healthy are busy occupying the island.

Captain Ibori is occupying Minesini, Captain Ekwensi is occupying Porto Hazena, and Captain Iwu is occupying Pinley. They can be found nearby their remaining armor, wearing berets.

Since the pirates have been destroyed, the Mawties are willing to occupy the island after SESO's engagement. Their forces will enter Hazena after the mission is accomplished.

__Mission:__ Neutralize the captains of the 91st, 92nd, and 94th

__Execution:__
1. Recon Hazena for a safe LZ
2. Enter the AO on the identified LZ
3. Neutralize the captains of the 91st, 92nd, and the 94th in any order
4. Retrieve the berets of Captain Ibori, Captain Ekwensi, and Captain Iwu
5. RTB

__Intel:__
PUB forces are up of mechanized infantry and armor. However, their pyrrhic victory over Hazena has left most of their vehicles inoperable. For the forces that do remain, they guard the captains and occupy towns across the island.

Hotel 1 will provide their helicopter for Bravo. Hotel 2 will provide the UAV operator with thermal vision over the AO. A technical armed with an M2 machine gun and a technical armed with an SPG launcher are available in the garage. They may be slingloaded with Hotel 1.

__Debriefing:__
The destruction of Kinsella’s entire mechanized branch has left PUBWAR in shock. The Mawties have occupied Hazena island. All PUB equipment has been requisitioned by Mawties for future engagements. State television has identified the Mawties by name, followed by “they are an Islamic extremist group funded by foreign powers.” It seems SESO has not yet been appeared on PUB intelligence.
