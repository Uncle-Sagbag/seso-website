__Operation Name:__ Angola

__Engagement Number:__ 7

__Situation:__ Kinsella’s capture has painted a new front to the civil war. Bantustan is cautious towards the formidable Mawt Nation, who are reported to be supported by blood-thirsty mercenaries. The new occupiers have destabilised the region, turning every stone to look for PUB supporters. The Mawties excised the system of Ujamaa from the region, the economic system dominant in PUB, leaving many unemployed while the Mawties implement a new economic system that adheres to Islamic traditions. Their leaders are preoccupied with occupation. This is their excuse as to why they are unable – or unwilling – to share intel from their PUB prisoners.


OPSCOM is blind without new intel on PUB forces. We are unsure if their troops have developed or remained frozen since the Kinsella siege. This is very dangerous for future excursions through Isla Duala. We reached out to an old informant, a former Namaquan policitian and a major stockholder in Califia Farms, to acquire new intel. He has found himself a comfortable position as a mayor in the PUB government and is willing to continue friendly relations with SESO.

His county is stricken by the sandstorms that sweep across Isla Duala. They are caused by poor agriculture and soil fertility. Since the system of Ujamaa was implemented, farmers are left unsupported. The informant asks for SESO to, once again, deliver bananas to him as payment for intel. The bananas would be used to plant new trees and enrich the soil near his county, possibly reducing sandstorms in Isla Duala. A shipment of bananas was enroute to Bantustan until it was intercepted and captured by the bandits in Simbala. The informant asks to return the bananas to his secret contact at the border crossing. The contact can only be met during the dark. Afterwards, he will send OPSCOM new intel.

Since Simbala is an bandit-occupied, the Mawties are willing to help.

__Intel:__
As per the contact's request, SESO will engage during the night.

Enemy forces are entirely bandit forces. They possess light arms, statics, technicals, and boats. During the night, they use flashlights and possess no NVs. De Boor, a nearby village, sends bandit patrols to the roads surrounding Simbala.

Mawt forces are part of Alpha squad. They will reinforce the siege with the equipment captured from Hazena. This includes armor and APCs.

Hotel 1 will provide their helicopter for Bravo. Hotel 2 will provide the UAV operator with thermal vision over the AO. A technical armed with an M2 machine gun and a technical armed with an SPG launcher are available in the garage. They may be slingloaded with Hotel 1.
