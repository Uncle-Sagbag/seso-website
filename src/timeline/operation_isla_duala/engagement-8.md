__Operation Name:__ Church

__Situation:__ With the president now saved, we can execute his final Mawt plan. We have selected the perfect day to land and engage the Mawt heartland.

All must be neutralized, including Nasser, and none can escape.

__Execution:__
1. Insert the assault team from the north.
2. Capture the Mortar Position north of the island.

Nasser has been eliminated and the Mawt Nation is in shambles. Do not expect them on the map any longer.

On a side note, the President is currently reviewing our progress. He found our constant violation of human rights appaling and refuses to house us at Fort Boko. We will need to relocate closer to the UN forces as they are the only ones to use our powers.
