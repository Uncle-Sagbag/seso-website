__Operation Name:__ Alcatraz

__Situation:__ After the rescue of Winter, the S.E.S.O. team attempted to escape the Namaquan forces but crashed right into the clutches of the BLA. In their daze, they were captured and interrogated by the rebels. Luckily, none of the team members talked during their week-long capture. Recently, fellow member got ahold of a pin to unlock their handcuffs. It shall be this Rescuer's mission to save his comrades and return to the FOB.

__Execution:__
1. Break out of handcuffs
2. Overtake the BLA fortress
3. Return to the FOB by any means necessary
4. OPTIONAL: Load the NATO SF Weapons case onto a vehicle and bring it back to the FOB to keep it for future operations.
NOTE: Respawns will be disabled for this operation since the team is completely disconnected from the FOB. However, you will receive a total of 4 mission restarts before the operation is declared a failure.
