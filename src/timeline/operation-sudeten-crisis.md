# Welcome to Marenice

**The Sudeten Crisis**

The Munich Agreement, the First Vienna Award, the Undeclared German-Czechoslovakian War, all these things will be experienced in this campaign. We begin at the earliest available conflict.

Marenice, an unimportant village on the borderlands of Czechoslovakia, shall house the divisions under the command of Colonel Karel Pavl√≠k. He has been tasked with Nazi suppression and fortifying the border with Germany.

It is September 1st, 1938. Fresh conscripts are being transferred to this region, some of them being the earliest members of S.E.S.O. The formation of the Nazi terrorist group Sudetendeutsches Freikorps, also known as SDF, is only 17 days away. The Czechs are at fear of the growing rise of Germanism in Central Europe, many speculating Czechoslovakia to be the next target. The largely German population of the Czech border have begun preparing for a guerilla war against Czech authorities, something the Czechs discovered after several arrests and searches of former members of the banned German National Socialist Workers' Party.

These conscripts, a proto-S.E.S.O., have been sent in to assist Colonel Pavlik on his primary tasks.
