# Welcome to the Crimean Crisis

On 22 May, 2014, the separatist nation of Novorossiya was declared in the eastern frontier of Ukraine. It came just in time as the ratification of the Resolution 68/262 which introduced UN peacekeepers to the region. It was on the 25th and not a day later was SESO brought in under contract of the UN. As part of a peacekeeping mission to stabilize the region and to neutralize the Novorossiya insurgency, small mercenary forces were hired to engage in counter insurgencies of their own . However, before SESO can even get started, they will need to pass FTX at the Bukovina Air Base, supervised by their very own UN Military Advisor named Cossack.
