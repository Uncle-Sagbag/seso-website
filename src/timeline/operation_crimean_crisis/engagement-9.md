__Battle Update Briefing__ Operation Black Bear
13th May 2014
1600

In Bravo's previous engagement, Novorossiya has attempted to assault a radio tower we believed was significant to them. A couple of days since the engagement, we have received word from Ukrainian sources that the village of Tulga has been brutally massacred. The only survivors are a doctor and a priest, the same priest you have spoken with before.

Bravo is advised to infiltrate the village of Tulga and rescue the hostages. Saving the hostages could inform us on the whereabouts of Belobog as he has been leading the massacre, according to unofficial sources.

Bravo is responsible for the vengeance of Tulga.
