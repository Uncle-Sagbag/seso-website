__Battle Update Briefing__

In Bravo's previous engagement, the border patrol in Pusta was wiped out and they had to call off their sweep of the region. On their way back to HQ Rail, A dog tag was retrieved from an identifiable Ukrainian traitor. Upon further analysis of this dog tag, Cossack discovered the traitor's name and history in Bystrica. Oleg Vasiliyev was a 27 year old man born from a majority Russian town not far from Bystrica. Military records indicate that Vasiliyev was a hot headed corporal who frequently buddied with his officer until his deployment in this region. Often, he was sighted meeting with various civilians. Two that have been identified are the priest in Tulga and the fisherman by the river. **Bravo is advised to meet the Tulga Priest and the fisherman to learn further of Vasiliyev's past.**

While it is essential to complete Operation Black Bear, Bravo's chances are much lower if the other PMCs were to be lost in the fight. Cossack presumes that they have been ambushed in a similar fashion as Bravo. There has been radio silence with Alpha and Charlie. **Bravo is advised to approach Alpha or Charlie carefully and identify the units.** Bravo is also advised to expect enemy contact on their way to or at the area of engagement.
