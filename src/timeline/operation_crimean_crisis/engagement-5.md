__Battle Update Briefing__ Operation Black Bear

In Bravo's previous engagements, they have gotten in contact with the Fisherman of the river and the Priest of Tulga. Afterwards, Bravo engaged the Novorossiya separatists in Nadezhdino where Alpha was being held hostage.

 **The Fisherman Pyotr Borichev was a red herring**, no pun intended. His only link to Vasiliyev was through a childhood friendship and through his wife, who would only send us down a goose chase.

**The Tulga Priest has given us a tip to the possible whereabouts of Belobog.** Located North of Tulga is a military camp disguised as a refugee camp. Night scans indicate this to be likely true as most individuals in the camp are men wielding AK-47s. Bravo is advised to conduct further recon in the area for an infiltration to be planned with high command. Cossack will instruct you on specific targets to identify and photograph. The priest was also worried for the safety of his village so UN Peacekeeping forces have been deployed to protect Tulga until the camp is cleared out.

**The rescue of Alpha was a pyrrhic victory as only a small percentage of the unit was found while the rest were KIA or MIA.** Alpha will **evac. Bystrica until they can fully recover at the Bukovina Airbase.** This leaves Bravo and possibly Charlie to continue Operation Black Bear.
