__Warsaw Operations:__

August 13th, 1944

__Option 1:__

'Head of the snake'

__Desc:__
With the help of our captured radio operator, we have been able to decipher the radio transmissions leading us the the conclusion that the Staff Office for the German divisions stationed within this area is somewhere close by, we have also been informed via the communications that the Officers leading each division are meeting to form a defensive line in case the Soviets are to attack. We plan to interrupt this and gain us a hand in unraveling any defense and sending German units within this area into disarray. Effectively solidifying our Resistance here.

__Plan:__
1. Ambush staff car with officer.
2. Dress as the officer and drive to guard station.
3. Ask for directions.
4. Eliminate guard after gaining intel and drive on Staff office.
5. Destroy staff office and any Officers there.

__Intel:__

Panzer/Armored Vehicle probability?: [☑️ ]

Artillery Probability?: [❌ ]

Luftwaffe presence?: [❌  ]

AP/AT Mines?: [❌ ]

☑️ = "Yes"

❌ = "No"

❔   = "Unknown"

__Option 2:__

'Spreading the Resistance once more'

__Desc:__

After the last operation, the many partisans that took part in the resistance at Staszow were either killed or captured. Many of said partisans that were captured are said to be loaded up in cars to be sent West. Using the captured radio Operator we dialed down each location of the POWs, or at least possible sites. We are to go there and liberate the prisoners. Using them as manpower to either guard our FOB and MOBs or to unleash back on their cells of resistance to make more trouble for the Germans.

__Plan:__
1. Recon each site for POWs.
2. Locate POWs and destroy German garrison.
3. Liberate captured partisans and release or take them back to base.

__Intel:__

Panzer/Armored Vehicle probability?: [☑️ ]

Artillery Probability?: [❌]

Luftwaffe presence?: [❌]

AP/AT Mines?: [❌]

__Note:__

Option 1's success will likely see a end to German Operations within this area, allowing us to further our grasp of our past lands on a further level. Making headway to Warsaw and working with the Russians to see this through.
