__Warsaw Operations:__

Now after stealing both the medical supplies and a tank we hold the ability to strike many locations with a greater chance of success with this armor, but rumors have circulated that German armor is on the move within this area due to the spike in partisan activity, but until then we hold the ability to take advantage of our new edge. Either securing more weapons for ourselves or stiffening German airpower within the region, the choice is up to us.

__Option 1:__

Steal weapons from the Depot and Crashed C-17

__Desc:__

We have been tipped off from our Allied connections that one of their C-17 transports that had been on the way to supply Warsaw directly was downed from German air within the area, they have given us this information in hopes we secure it before the Germans are able to ship it and steal it to elsewhere.

Along with that we have selected the Arms Depot and Barracks as a target for this raid, using our tank to overwhelm the garrison and steal the fully stocked trucks and bring them back to base.

__Plan:__

As I have mentioned there is two parts to this option, stealing supply boxes from the C-17 and from the depot, we know there is a minimal but still present bit of mechanized Germans in the area of both of the options so it is advised to take things slow, but the quick way of explaining the plan for the depot and crash site is this,

For the C-17 crash we have a approximate area of where the crash and boxes may be, but firstly you are to find it eliminate any Germans that may prove to be a hinderance near there, then load the equipment into any trucks you may bring and ship it back to base.

For the depot, you are to eliminate the garrison, secure the trucks loaded with supplies and also return them all to base.

__Option 2:__

Raiding the airfield.

__Desc:__

German airpower within our region of operations has provided a relative annoyance and given they can use it for close air support, recon, interception, and other tasks it has been decided we have had enough.

__Plan:__

This is also a very straightforward task in terms of planning, as our main objective is to really just decimate any fueling and aircraft within the airfield as well as its defenses to negate it as a threat for any further operations, 

Our main goal is the aircraft themselves, using charges and explosives provided we will take out any sentries then move to the aircraft, placing explosives in the corresponding areas and if we have extras, we can place them on the fuel silos. From there we can evacuate the area and leave it as a wrap once the targets are detonated.
