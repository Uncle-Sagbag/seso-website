__Brief Type:__ Information

__Operation Name:__ Burning Buddhist

__Engagement Number:__ 7th

__Situation:__ SESO has selected OBJ Salmon as the next mission. OBJ Salmon and OBJ Czech are unpeopled villages occupied by PAVN forces, the best equipped and most powerful from the North Vietnamese. These forces can easily overpower FULRO if left any longer near us. Thus, attempting to complete the mission at OBJ Salmon will require work on OBJ Czech.

__Mission:__ Capture OBJ Salmon & OBJ Czech from PAVN forces

__Execution:__
1. Approach either OBJ
2. Identify the Tank Squad
3. Identify the location of the anti-tank cache
4. Acquire the anti-tank weapons
5. Eliminate the Tank squad using the anti-tank weapons
6. Sweep through OBJ Salmon and OBJ Czech

__Intel:__

PAVN forces use tactics more familiar with ARVN forces: both use superior firepower and equipment to overpower the enemy. Unlike the VC, traps are not laid down and these do not hide in the jungles. To eliminate an enemy with superior equipment is to pick your battles. Do not approach them with all of their guns pointed at you. Eliminate each weapon one by one.

Since the PAVN have just conquered OBJ Salmon from USAF, they still have their 3-tank squad patrolling the path dotted on the map. They will relocate and join any engagement between these objectives. Scouts report OBJ Czech has anti-tank weapon caches which can be quickly stolen to use against the tank squad. Engaging OBJ Czech swiftly to get their caches to use against the tanks is advised.

__Operation Result:__ Loss!

OBJ Salmon and OBJ Czech were impenetrable for SESO operatives. The PAVN forces will be residing in the AO to deter FULRO forces from advancing Southwards. They will strengthen themselves for another SESO attack.
