__Brief Type:__ Decision

__Operation Name:__ Burning Buddhist

__Engagement Number:__ 6th:

__Procedure:__

SESO, observe the following image to get a full bearing of the possible missions. There are 3 decisions available: **engage at OBJ Land Chop :one: , engage at OBJ Aphsok Bridge :two: , or abandon the contract :SESO:**.

Please cast your **one vote** on the image once you have fully read the intel. When mission time approaches, the decision with the most votes shall be our next mission:

__Assumptions:__

Being that we are no longer connected to western intelligence, our own intel runs off assumptions.

**OBJ Land Chop :one:** is an active lumber camp utilized by enemy forces to import supplies from Cambodia. Likely combatants are either VC or USMC. Upon mission success, their supplies shall taken by FULRO and grant us **M1941 82mm Mortars** to our arsenal. In addition, we will be coming closer to Communist forces.

**OBJ Aphsok Bridge :two:** is the northern third of the town of Phoum Srei Aphsok. Likely combatants are ARVN. Unlike other objectives, dedicating forces to the capture of Aphsok Bridge will also require us to keep our momentum towards OBJ Prey and OBJ Hillbilly. Only after all three are captured in one engagement, we will have mission success. Our reward for such an achievement is coming closer to Western forces and **CIDG PBR support** due to the ports on the river.

**Abandoning the contract :SESO:** will require SESO operatives to conduct a night raid upon FOB Liquor to assassinate General Thi then EVAC PKL through the river, encountering every enemy known to us. It is a high risk mission as a loss would conclude the lives of all of our SESO operatives in the campaign. However, mission success would conclude the campaign with a reward from the ARVN government, albeit tarnishing our reputation permanently.
