__Operation Name:__ Burning Buddhist

__Engagement Number__ 5th

__Situation:__ After the coup at Saigon, General Thi is no longer a General and is hunted as a war criminal. All of his progress is lost except for the men and equipment of FOB Penh. However, FOB Penh is now surrounded by hostile forces from both sides: ARVN and VC. It is only a matter of time until former friendly artillery rains down on the FOB. Thi has planned an EVAC from the southern border of PKL to move to an abandoned French colony called Le Coq d'or. SESO and CIDG will be taking two different routes to Le Coq d'or. Once they get there, the location will be given a callsign and established as the first FOB of the newly-created FULRO faction.

__Mission:__ Rendezvous at Le Coq d'or

__Execution:__
1. Board either land vehicles or patrol boats
2. Push Northward through hostile forces
3. Rendezvous at Le Coq d'or

__Intel:__
With a new opponent, the ARVN, our strategy changes. The ARVN are better outfitted with greater number of vehicles, supports, and statics. However, their weakness is their lack of mobility, a trait more popular with their US counterparts. The ideal tactic to defeat the ARVN is to avoid their front and flank from their sides.

The VC will be hiding within the jungles of West PKL. Expect them in the least expected places.

Fortunately, our latest intel on artillery still applies. Evidently, we no longer have artillery support. Rather, we have to avoid their artillery fire. As soon as SESO is spotted by ARVN forces, they have a chance to call in artillery support. The first shot is always a ranging shot which acts as a warning for SESO. After the first shot, every subsequent shot will be more accurate and more devastating.

__Operation Result:__ Success!

The new FOB is established under callsign **FOB Liquor**. From here on, FULRO will thrive.
