## Operation Osiris
# "Recoup & Rebound" 

__Engagement:__ #2

__Situation:__ The invasion of Chernarus's northeast coast last night occured parallel to our first engagement. While Alpha was entirely successful in their destruction of artillery assets and other assigned objectives this was not enough to break the tide. Elements of the CDF invasion in the north were bogged down by relentless counter-attacks and air suppresion. As a result their landing was repulsed with only some headway being made in the south, but it is unknown how long they will be able to holdout or extend the beachhead. This inability to properly sieze the beach and take the airfield left S.E.S.O. without many options since their method of transportation had already been shot down. As a result Alpha spent the night at a rendezvous point ,"RV Black Mountain", a long unmaintained fortress. During the night S.E.S.O. has remained out of contact with HQ and ordered to by any means meet up with friendly CDF forces. Hours later S.E.S.O. was approached by a contact claiming to a servant to be a "Kozlov". After a conversation in which S.E.S.O. explained their situation and the man his. They made an offer to give Alpha a method of transporation and passage through their lines to friendly CDF forces in exchange for help in retrieving their brethren.

The stipulations of this deal concluded that S.E.S.O. would liberate the correctional facility nearby RV Black Mountain and return the prisoners to Devil's Castle. As well as this, if they decided to assist in lifting the siege upon the home of Kozlov and his forces, the Devil's Castle, by destroying logsitic trucks in the town of Gvozdno. Though this second objective was only brought up as a possbility to which Kozlov would appreciate their help. The men captured include soldiers from Kozlov's army and Kozlov's heir, Oleg Kozlov, who remains a prisoner of the correctional facility. To properly be able to navigate a way out of the AO and bring the prisoners back to Devil's castle the location of several checkpoints that would need to be destroyed was brought to S.E.S.O.'s attention. In addition to this the location of a downed C-130 cargo plane containing a shipment of munitions and more importantly suppressors was identified to S.E.S.O. Though this was of no use to Kozlov as his men possess no PPE to navigate the deadzone that surrounds it. If Alpha decides to navigate through the deadzone and retrieve said shipments the suppressors could be utilized to cover any noise made by the assualt on the facility, hopefully preventing ChDKZ reinforcement. Lastly, the munitions procured from the C-130 could be used for detonation of the mentioned logistical vehicles. 

While much information was provided on the details of this plan, the envoy from Kozlov mentioned he would have an officer slip through the siege to offer clarification, intel, and advice for Alpha's members. It should be mentioned that the envoy specified they would only allow two members of S.E.S.O. to accompany whoever wished to speak with them. Because of this it is recommended to split forces and either recon or ascertain the C-130 shipments while and if Alpha decides to contact the officer.

__Mission:__ Procure a method of transportation by helping Kozlov's forces in order to rendezvous with friendly CDF elements.

__Execution:__
1. Investigate meeting Location and officer. 
2. Navigate through the nearby deadzone to secure suppresors and munitions. (Optional)
3. Eliminate checkpoints. (CPs)
4. Detonate logistic trucks in the village of Gvozdno (Optional)
5. Secure VIP from the Seperate Hall and captured soldiers from the Detention Building within the Correctional Facility.
6. Return prisoners to Devil's Castle using path cleared of checkpoints.
7. Use given transport to rendezvous with nearest CDF forces. 

__Intel:__

The Composition of the enemy ChDKZ force consists of primarily Infantry and light mechanized groups. It is assumed heavier ordnance, armored groups, artillery batteries, and air assault assets will be tied up with remaining CDF forces on the beach or garrisoning locations to the east. 

Contact with HQ has been spotty so all support assets that would typically be provided will be unavailable to be guided in by JTAC as of now. 

Lastly, zones marked in black within the AO are indicators of irradiated zones. These are lethal to 
anyone who enters without proper PPE, but should they be encountered it is recommended to deviate around them unless necessary. 

Our knowledge on the men approached by Alpha, the "Devil's of Kozlov, is limited. From our understanding this faction is one that rose up in the midst of the civil war and claim to have sworn fealty to a King named Kozlov. He and his "realm" occupy previous ruins of a long gone monarchy within the Caucasus region, specifically Chernarus. He and his men harass vehicles of both the CDF and ChDKZ and enforce their occupation over most surrounding lands and roadways near their forts. Notably they often harass ChDKZ supply runs on Causeway 222, the main lifeline to the nearby ChDKZ airbase. Due to these efforts the ChDKZ have been sieging the Devil's Castle for some time and thus the exact people S.E.S.O. should remain in contact with for transport to CDF lines as that is their specialty.
