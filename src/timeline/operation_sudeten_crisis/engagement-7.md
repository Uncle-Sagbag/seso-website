__Operation Name:__ Henlein

__Situation:__ After our recent defeats, High Command has been eager to relocate the conscripts of Camp Gryphon to food duty back in Prague. However, with Korolenko's charisma and puppy eyes, the conscripts were given one more chance. High Command would keep the conscripts at Camp Gryphon for military duty only if they could successfully rescue the diplomats kidnapped back from Operation Runciman. If they could rescue both of the diplomats, they could remain in duty. If they cannot, they will be demoted to lunch ladies. 

__Mission:__ Rescue diplomats Petr Nejedly and Sergeikovich from Nazi hands

__Execution:__
1. Acquire a vehicle
2. Completely sweep through one quadrant at a time
3. Relay any suspicious contacts to Sergeant Korolenko
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until all quadrants are found
5. Once the Nazi/SFK base is found, regroup with Korolenko
6. Engage the Nazi/SFK base
7. Rescue the diplomats and return them to Camp Gryphon

Key:
Orange Lines - Roads
Blue Circle - Area of Possible Nazi Bases
Yellow Border - Quadrant Border
