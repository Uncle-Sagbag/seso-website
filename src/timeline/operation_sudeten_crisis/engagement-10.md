__Contract__ Hill 12
__Operation Name:__ "Don't fire until you see the whites of their eyes!‚Äù

__Date:__ October 4th,1938

__Situation:__ Now that S.E.S.O has depleted the ammo stocks of the Mortar position, silenced the radio traffic in and out of Hill 12 and, taken over their only life line route to the rest of Czechoslovakia, Oberst Karl Lorenz has dictated this as our time to strike. Given mostly due to the situation S.E.S.O has caused in Hill 12 and also their low man power and supplies. But the Czechs are smart enough to see this eventual attack coming their way and they have kindly layered the direct surrounding area of the position in all the mines they could find. 

__Mission:__

Old but reasonably accurate intel provided has shown that Hill 12 is not only low on manpower and supply but the garrison has barely dug in, but the factor of the mines still remains a annoyance,but due to some digging in we have reason to believe the location of all mines is in one of the marked garrison positions (As foot patrols need the map to not blow up themselves up on the way in and out of their position. So SESO is to recover these files and use these to infiltrate the position, but the lingering fact of the Artillery in Hill 12 means that they will most likely harass SESO forces as they move with fire missions giving SESO a minute to two minute time limit after the first shot cracks off in a garrison post. These factors mostly the positive have urged the Oberst to get us on the way of eliminating and, silencing this position once and for all.

__Execution:__
1. Arrive outside Hill 12
2. Ascertain a map of the minefield from one of three garrison points.
3. Clean up any patrols and or garrisons outside the actual position.
4. Navigate minefield and sweep Hill 12.
5. Hold down camp in case of any outside counterattacks.
