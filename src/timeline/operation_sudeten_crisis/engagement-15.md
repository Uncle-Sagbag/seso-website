__Contract:__ ==SECRET==

__Operation Name:__ Trident

__Date:__ October 21st, 1938

__Situation:__ The scales have tipped and the Germans are overpowering the rogue Czech militia. It is a matter of time until the war is deemed a mere skirmish by historians. However, this spells bad news for S.E.S.O. Surrounded by the ultra-traditional and prestigious Nazi Germany, the unit would be doomed if it remains any longer in their territory. Oberst Karl Lorenz needs to keep his reputation intact. Having any evidence of hiring mercenaries would not look good on Lorenz. Thus, it would not be far-fetched for them to put their targets on us. Because of this, we need to escape Marenice. Damien Valkyrie would house us really nicely if we carry out this contract for him. He wants Colonel Karel Pavlik dead, for one reason or another. Once he is dead, Damien is sure to protect us.

__Mission:__ Assassinate Colonel Karel Pavlik

__Execution:__
1. Decide between three Entrances to HQ Mistek.
    - Entrance Bigfoot - Loud Entrance, requires combat through forest to snipe the Colonel
    - Entrance Smoothwater - Quiet entrance, requires charisma to enter the base and execute the Colonel
    - Entrance Judas - Quiet entrance, requires the right timing to transport sensitive explosives into the base
2. Eliminate Karel Pavlik in any manner
3. Escape Marenice through the Southern Route

__Enemy Intelligence:__ Expect random inspections and guards all over the road. You will need to make sure you do not seem suspicious during this operation or you will be forced to go through Entrance Bigfoot.

Also, Colonel Karel Pavlik may escape if you go loud for too long. High Command always go running with a tail between their legs at any sight of warfare.
