What was from the Poles perspective a long awaited day, the Warsaw Uprising where both retired soldiers and civilians alike took to arms has now started.  Combatants scrounged whatever they could from the already in ruin city... and have begun fighting the occupying Germans. With spirits high and hatred in their hearts the Poles have begun to outwardly fight back against the Germans on their own soil since '39.

Allied C-17s have already begun flowing over from Italy to Polish territory to drop supplies and rations to the now risen up Home Army. Though the Soviets have declined to let the allies use their own airfields they are persistent about their help. 

Now the fight begins.
