__Battle Update Briefing__ Operation Black Bear
15 May 2014

In Bravo's previous engagement, the Priest of Tulga has been rescued. In order to assist in our operation, the Priest was able to identify the whereabouts of Belobog and his likeness. The image above was captured in his cell phone. It shows Belobog's equipment and his whereabouts in Polana. Further scouting intel can confirm this to be true as Polana is heavily occupied by Novorossiya.

As Bravo's final day in Operation Black Bear, they will be assigned to infiltrate and neutralize Belobog within this town. Consider this to be the hardest task for Bravo as Polana is in the furthest reaches of Novorossiya territory. Cossack will advise the exact steps on how to carry the neutralization. What is certain is that a frontal assault is suicide. Rather, Bravo will need to use their environment and expert infiltration abilities to complete the mission.

This is the final day for Operation Black Bear. Everything depends on Bravo's success as Alpha and Charlie have been in evac.

Remember that the only thing standing between SESO's gear now versus later is a bullet in Belobog.
