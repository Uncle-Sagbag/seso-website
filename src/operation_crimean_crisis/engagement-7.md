__Battle Update Briefing__ Operation Black Bear
10th May 2014
1000

In Bravo's previous engagement, the Novorossiyan camp was eliminated. During the engagement, Bravo have found a map with crosses on every village. HQ will run an analysis with this map and attempt to match it with any other intel on the Novorossiya insurgency.

Coming up this fine morning is the parade of the new governor of Bystirca, Egor Tokarev. A very bold and simple individual, he believed that to boost the support of his platform, he must hold a parade across the majority of Bystrica's towns down by the river. He has hired Bravo to protect his parade from any possible EMP attacks. In short, Bravo will be guarding Tokarev's parade by protecting key electricity infrastructure in the city of Electrozavodsk. Failure to guard these infrastructure will be a shutdown of the city's electrical grid and loss of support towards the Ukrainian government.
