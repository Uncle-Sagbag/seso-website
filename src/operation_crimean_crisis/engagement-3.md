__Operation Name:__ Black Bear

__Situation:__ Bystrica, a region within North Crimea, has been particularly hostile to any Ukrainian convoys. Since the declaration of Novorossiya, the hostile forces have grouped together to create a fully supplied Novorossiyan insurgency. This was done with the help of their chief propagandist codenamed "Belobog." As such, the PMCs have been deployed to find intel on Belobog and neutralize the mere insurgency at the head of the snake. The Lieutenant Malyukov has ordered Alpha, Bravo, and Charlie to contact their respective border patrols searching for Belobog. Once they do, they can begin a sweep through the thick woodlands of rural Bystrica.

__Mission:__ Find and neutralize Belobog

__Execution:__
1. Deploy at FOB Rail
2. Gather needed supplies
3. Meet the border patrol in Pusta
4. Follow the instructions of their Border Officer
