__Operation Name:__ FTX Part 2

__Situation:__ At the next day, all of the PMC groups are to go through a CQB test in an abandoned village to the South of the base. The groups will compete against each other for the best completion time and least amount of casualties. While we wait for Quontrol and ION to carry their tests, SESO will be quickly briefed up on everything they have missed since last time.

__Mission:__ Pass the CQB Test

__Execution:__
1. Meet with Lieutenant Malyukov first thing in the morning
2. Re-train with Cossack about things from FTX Part 1
3. Meet with Lieutenant Malyukov again for the CQB test briefing
4. Carry out the test and try to beat all other PMCs

__Operation Result:__ Success!
SESO was given second place after the CQB test. As a result, Quontrol is now Alpha, SESO is Bravo, and ION Charlie. Next week, when the PMCs are deployed, these  callsigns will be used.
